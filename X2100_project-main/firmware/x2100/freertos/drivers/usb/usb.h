/**

 * @match_flags: Bit mask controlling which of the other fields are used to

 *	used, although some only make sense in conjunction with other fields.
 *	This is usually set by a USB_DEVICE_*() macro, which sets all
 *	other fields in this structure except for driver_info.
 * @idVendor: USB vendor ID for a device; numbers are assigned
 *	by the USB forum to its members.
 * @idProduct: Vendor-assigned product ID.
 * @bcdDevice_lo: Low end of range of vendor-assigned product version numbers.
 *	This is also used to identify individual product versions, for
 *	a range consisting of a single device.
 * @bcdDevice_hi: High end of version number range.  The range of product
 *	versions is inclusive.
 * @bDeviceClass: Class of device; numbers are assigned
 *	by the USB forum.  Products may choose to implement classes,
 *	or be vendor-specific.  Device classes specify behavior of all
 *	the interfaces on a device.
 * @bDeviceSubClass: Subclass of device; associated with bDeviceClass.
 * @bDeviceProtocol: Protocol of device; associated with bDeviceClass.
 * @bInterfaceClass: Class of interface; numbers are assigned
 *	by the USB forum.  Products may choose to implement classes,
 *	or be vendor-specific.  Interface classes specify behavior only
 *	of a given interface; other interfaces may support other classes.
 * @bInterfaceSubClass: Subclass of interface; associated with bInterfaceClass.
 * @bInterfaceProtocol: Protocol of interface; associated with bInterfaceClass.
 * @bInterfaceNumber: Number of interface; composite devices may use
 *	fixed interface numbers to differentiate between vendor-specific
 *	interfaces.
 * @driver_info: Holds information used by the driver.  Usually it holds
 *	a pointer to a descriptor understood by the driver, or perhaps
 *	device flags.
 *
 * In most cases, drivers will create a table of device IDs by using
 * USB_DEVICE(), or similar macros designed for that purpose.
 * They will then export it to userspace using MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(),
 * and provide it to the USB core through their usb_driver structure.
 *
 * See the usb_match_id() function for information about how matches are
 * performed.  Briefly, you will normally use one of several macros to help
 * construct these entries.  Each entry you provide will either identify
 * one or more specific products, or will identify a class of products
 * which have agreed to behave the same.  You should put the more specific
 * matches towards the beginning of your table, so that driver_info can
 * record quirks of specific products.

 *
 * USB device drivers attach to interfaces on a physical device.  Each
 * interface encapsulates a single high level function, such as feeding
 * an audio stream to a speaker or reporting a change in a volume control.
 * Many USB devices only have one interface.  The protocol used to talk to
 * an interface's endpoints can be defined in a usb "class" specification,
 * or by a product's vendor.  The (default) control endpoint is part of
 * every interface, but is never listed among the interface's descriptors.
 *
 * The driver that is bound to the interface can use standard driver model
 * calls such as dev_get_drvdata() on the dev member of this structure.
 *
 * Each interface may have alternate settings.  The initial configuration
 * of a device sets altsetting 0, but the device driver can change
 * that setting using usb_set_interface().  Alternate settings are often
 * used to control the use of periodic endpoints, such as by having
 * different endpoints use different amounts of reserved USB bandwidth.
 * All standards-conformant USB devices that use isochronous endpoints
 * will use them in non-default settings.
 *
 * The USB specification says that alternate setting numbers must run from
 * 0 to one less than the total number of alternate settings.  But some
 * devices manage to mess this up, and the structures aren't necessarily
 * stored in numerical order anyhow.  Use usb_altnum_to_altsetting() to

/**
 * struct urb - USB Request Block
 * @urb_list: For use by current owner of the URB.
 * @pipe: Holds endpoint number, direction, type, and more.
 *	Create these values with the eight macros available;
 *	usb_{snd,rcv}TYPEpipe(dev,endpoint), where the TYPE is "ctrl"
 *	(control), "bulk", "int" (interrupt), or "iso" (isochronous).
 *	For example usb_sndbulkpipe() or usb_rcvintpipe().  Endpoint
 *	numbers range from zero to fifteen.  Note that "in" endpoint two
 *	is a different endpoint (and pipe) from "out" endpoint two.
 *	The current configuration controls the existence, type, and
 *	maximum packet size of any given endpoint.
 * @dev: Identifies the USB device to perform the request.
 * @status: This is read in non-iso completion functions to get the
 *	status of the particular request.  ISO requests only use it
 *	to tell whether the URB was unlinked; detailed status for
 *	each frame is in the fields of the iso_frame-desc.
 * @transfer_flags: A variety of flags may be used to affect how URB
 *	submission, unlinking, or operation are handled.  Different
 *	kinds of URB can use different flags.
 * @transfer_buffer:  This identifies the buffer to (or from) which
 * 	the I/O request will be performed (unless URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP
 *	is set).  This buffer must be suitable for DMA; allocate it with
 *	kmalloc() or equivalent.  For transfers to "in" endpoints, contents
 *	of this buffer will be modified.  This buffer is used for the data
 *	stage of control transfers.
 * @transfer_dma: When transfer_flags includes URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP,
 *	the device driver is saying that it provided this DMA address,
 *	which the host controller driver should use in preference to the
 *	transfer_buffer.
 * @transfer_buffer_length: How big is transfer_buffer.  The transfer may
 *	be broken up into chunks according to the current maximum packet
 *	size for the endpoint, which is a function of the configuration
 *	and is encoded in the pipe.  When the length is zero, neither
 *	transfer_buffer nor transfer_dma is used.
 * @actual_length: This is read in non-iso completion functions, and
 *	it tells how many bytes (out of transfer_buffer_length) were
 *	transferred.  It will normally be the same as requested, unless
 *	either an error was reported or a short read was performed.
 *	The URB_SHORT_NOT_OK transfer flag may be used to make such
 *	short reads be reported as errors. 
 * @setup_packet: Only used for control transfers, this points to eight bytes
 *	of setup data.  Control transfers always start by sending this data
 *	to the device.  Then transfer_buffer is read or written, if needed.
 * @setup_dma: For control transfers with URB_NO_SETUP_DMA_MAP set, the
 *	device driver has provided this DMA address for the setup packet.
 *	The host controller driver should use this in preference to
 *	setup_packet.
 * @start_frame: Returns the initial frame for isochronous transfers.
 * @number_of_packets: Lists the number of ISO transfer buffers.
 * @interval: Specifies the polling interval for interrupt or isochronous
 *	transfers.  The units are frames (milliseconds) for for full and low
 *	speed devices, and microframes (1/8 millisecond) for highspeed ones.
 * @error_count: Returns the number of ISO transfers that reported errors.
 * @context: For use in completion functions.  This normally points to
 *	request-specific driver context.
 * @complete: Completion handler. This URB is passed as the parameter to the
 *	completion function.  The completion function may then do what
 *	it likes with the URB, including resubmitting or freeing it.
 * @iso_frame_desc: Used to provide arrays of ISO transfer buffers and to 
 *	collect the transfer status for each buffer.
 *
 * This structure identifies USB transfer requests.  URBs must be allocated by
 * calling usb_alloc_urb() and freed with a call to usb_free_urb().
 * Initialization may be done using various usb_fill_*_urb() functions.  URBs
 * are submitted using usb_submit_urb(), and pending requests may be canceled
 * using usb_unlink_urb() or usb_kill_urb().
 *
 * Data Transfer Buffers:
 *
 * Normally drivers provide I/O buffers allocated with kmalloc() or otherwise
 * taken from the general page pool.  That is provided by transfer_buffer
 * (control requests also use setup_packet), and host controller drivers
 * perform a dma mapping (and unmapping) for each buffer transferred.  Those
 * mapping operations can be expensive on some platforms (perhaps using a dma
 * bounce buffer or talking to an IOMMU),
 * although they're cheap on commodity x86 and ppc hardware.
 *
 * Alternatively, drivers may pass the URB_NO_xxx_DMA_MAP transfer flags,
 * which tell the host controller driver that no such mapping is needed since
 * the device driver is DMA-aware.  For example, a device driver might
 * allocate a DMA buffer with usb_alloc_coherent() or call usb_free_coherent().
 * When these transfer flags are provided, host controller drivers will
 * attempt to use the dma addresses found in the transfer_dma and/or
 * setup_dma fields rather than determining a dma address themselves.  (Note
 * that transfer_buffer and setup_packet must still be set because not all
 * host controllers use DMA, nor do virtual root hubs).
 *
 * Initialization:
 *
 * All URBs must also initialize 
 * transfer_buffer and transfer_buffer_length.  They may provide the
 * URB_SHORT_NOT_OK transfer flag, indicating that short reads are
 * to be treated as errors; that flag is invalid for write requests.
 *
 * Bulk URBs may
 * use the URB_ZERO_PACKET transfer flag, indicating that bulk OUT transfers
 * should always terminate with a short packet, even if it means adding an
 * extra zero length packet.
 *
 * Control URBs must provide a setup_packet.  The setup_packet and
 * transfer_buffer may each be mapped for DMA or not, independently of
 * the other.  The transfer_flags bits URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP and
 * URB_NO_SETUP_DMA_MAP indicate which buffers have already been mapped.
 * URB_NO_SETUP_DMA_MAP is ignored for non-control URBs.
 *
 * Interrupt URBs must provide an interval, saying how often (in milliseconds
 * or, for highspeed devices, 125 microsecond units)
 * to poll for transfers.  After the URB has been submitted, the interval
 * field reflects how the transfer was actually scheduled.
 * The polling interval may be more frequent than requested.
 * For example, some controllers have a maximum interval of 32 milliseconds,
 * while others support intervals of up to 1024 milliseconds.
 * Isochronous URBs also have transfer intervals.  (Note that for isochronous
 * endpoints, as well as high speed interrupt endpoints, the encoding of
 * the transfer interval in the endpoint descriptor is logarithmic.
 * Device drivers must convert that value to linear units themselves.)
 *
 * Isochronous URBs normally use the URB_ISO_ASAP transfer flag, telling
 * the host controller to schedule the transfer as soon as bandwidth
 * utilization allows, and then set start_frame to reflect the actual frame
 * selected during submission.  Otherwise drivers must specify the start_frame
 * and handle the case where the transfer can't begin then.  However, drivers
 * won't know how bandwidth is currently allocated, and while they can
 * find the current frame using usb_get_current_frame_number () they can't
 * know the range for that frame number.  (Ranges for frame counter values
 * are HC-specific, and can go from 256 to 65536 frames from "now".)
 *
 * Isochronous URBs have a different data transfer model, in part because
 * the quality of service is only "best effort".  Callers provide specially
 * allocated URBs, with number_of_packets worth of iso_frame_desc structures
 * at the end.  Each such packet is an individual ISO transfer.  Isochronous
 * URBs are normally queued, submitted by drivers to arrange that
 * transfers are at least double buffered, and then explicitly resubmitted
 * in completion handlers, so
 * that data (such as audio or video) streams at as constant a rate as the
 * host controller scheduler can support.
 *
 * Completion Callbacks:
 *
 * The completion callback is made in_interrupt(), and one of the first
 * things that a completion handler should do is check the status field.
 * The status field is provided for all URBs.  It is used to report
 * unlinked URBs, and status for all non-ISO transfers.  It should not
 * be examined before the URB is returned to the completion handler.
 *
 * The context field is normally used to link URBs back to the relevant
 * driver or request state.
 *
 * When the completion callback is invoked for non-isochronous URBs, the
 * actual_length field tells how many bytes were transferred.  This field
 * is updated even when the URB terminated with an error or was unlinked.
 *
 * ISO transfer status is reported in the status and actual_length fields
 * of the iso_frame_desc array, and the number of errors is reported in
 * error_count.  Completion callbacks for ISO transfers will normally
 * (re)submit URBs to ensure a constant transfer rate.
